<h3>
    How a routine sightseeing flight for an Air New Zealand DC-10 Jetliner ended in disaster
</h3>

<p>
    It was a clear day on November 28, 1979, when an Air New Zealand DC-10 flight was due to take off from Auckland. These flights were not regular, as they were used for special sightseeing tours in ANntarctica, started back in 1977.
    In order to ensure safety, these flights were piloted by ANZ's veteran pilots. This flight wasn't any different from any other trip to Captain Jim Collins and First Officer Gordon Vette, both of whom had extensive experience flying in the Antarctic region.
    However, unbeknownst to them, the airline changed something that would have dire consequences.

<p>
    The DC-10, registered as ZK-NZP took off en route to view Mount Erebus, an active volcano on Ross Island in Antarctica. The flight, according to what the crew member would have known at the time, was flying to a point east of the mountain and McMurdo station, before turning around and heading back.
    The aircraft was approaching the icy lands of Antarctica at an altitude of 10,000 feet over what was believed was the flat icy shelf from previous flights. 
    Captain Colins told McMurdo station that they'd be descending down to 2000 feet. However, after this, radio contact was lost. The US Navy stated that the plane failed to acknowledge radio contact. As more
    time passed, concern grew. The plane was due to return to Christchurch later that day, but it never did. When enough time had passed for the aircraft to have run out of fuel, the plane was labeled lost.

<p>
    Rescue teams were sent to look for the plane, fearing the worst. Almost 3 hours later, the worst was confimed when a black streak was discovered on the slopes of Mount Erebus. The plane had slammed into the mountain.
    All 257 people on board were killed, making it not only the deadliest air disaster in New Zealand's history, but the deadliest peacetime tragedy in the country overall.
    The crash also severely muddied the DC-10's already bad reputation.

    Operation Overdue was created to recover the bodies and wreckage. The recovery operation was difficult due to the harsh weather conditions and the remote location of the crash site.
    In the mean time, something suspicious happened. The widowed wife of Captain Collins came home to find her home broken into, and multiple things stolen. Bizzarely, valuables such as jewelry were safe, but tape recorders, passports, and other insignificant things were stolen.
    Most bizzarely, a photo of Jim Collins was torn and placed back. The burglar was never found.

    Investigators found that the captain had gone below the safe altitude. However, why the captain didn't see the gigantic volcano in front of him wasn't explained yet.
    Lead investigator Chippindale suspected that a white out effect, where light reflects off the snow and ice, blending terrain into a white void, blended the mountain with the sky.
    This effect was not trained for by ANZ. Chippindale concluded that the captain's descent caused the crash, but one question remained. Most sightseeing flights led out into the ross shelf.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Why did this one end up in Erebus?</b>
</p>

<p>
    A royal commission was tasked to find the cause as well, led by Justice Peter Mahon. Mahon found that the intended flight plan for all sightseeing flights was McMurdo sound, where ANZ901 was headed to. However,
    most flights followed an incorrectly filed waypoint, taking them over the Ross Ice Shelf. This false waypoint mistake was unnoticed until November 14 1979 by pilot Les Simpson.
    He informed ANZ, which then corrected the waypoint. However, ANZ failed to inform the flight crew of the next flight of this change.
    The next flight was the fateful Air New Zealand 901. Mahon also reviewed the Cockpit Voice Recorder's transcript. It was found that ANZ hired a British voice analysis expert who deciphered lines that differed from the ones originally given by colleagues of ANZ901's crew.
    The most telling line was the phrase "Bit thick here, eh Bert?", a line initially marked an unintelligible by the colleagues. No one was named Bert.
    Mahon found that Chippindale didn't use any evidence suggesting that Collins expected the wrong waypoint. 
</p>

<p>
    Mahon's next task was concluding if the crew made an error in descending. He found that every sightseeing flight descended below the safe distances with approval of ANZ.
    The wrong waypoint also offered better views than the correct one. He also said that the crew was justified in descending, as the weather was supposedly clear and they believed they were over the ice shelf.
    Mahon concluded that the blame lay entirely within Air New Zealand for the failure to inform flight crews, clearing Captain Collins's name.
    But Mahon found something else, evidence of something sinister happening within ANZ. Evidence given by ANZ struck as questionable, a shredding operation shortly after the crash, made the airline extremely suspicious.
    After extensive work, Justice Mahon concluded that Air New Zealand had tried to deceive him, and tried to cover up their own involvement.
</p>

<p>
    The Mahon report was released in 1980, blaming ANZ for the crash and clearing the crew of any blame. He called the coverup attempt an "Orchestrated Litany of Lies". The report on April of 1981 released a can of worms for New Zealand's government, which owned the airline at the time.
    Prime Minister Muldoon, who had friends in ANZ, attacked Mahon with the advice of his lawyer who also worked for ANZ. He blamed the pilots for the crash, sparking outrage in the masses. Air New Zealand asked the High Court to determine if Mahon had violated laws by blaming them.
    Unfortunately, the High Court sided with Air New Zealand, with two judges, who worked for ANZ, defaming Mahon. Mahon tried to appeal to the Privy Council in London, but they sided against him. However, in the eyes
    of the masses, Mahon was correct, and was appaled by the government's actions. 
</p>

<p>
    The Erebus disaster changed not only aviation, but New Zealand as a whole. The phrase "Orchestrated Litany of Lies" became a common phrase in New Zealand. 40 years after the disaster, The 39 year old Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern apologized to the families and on behalf of the airline. 
    Air New Zealand never offered any more antarctic sightseeing flights after the disaster, with Qantas being the only airline to offer them now.
    Today, the wreckage of the plane remains on the slopes of Mount Erebus, serving as a reminder of the tragedy that occurred that day, and the cascade that followed it.
