## 1/ Five topics I know well

1. How to use console.log(). This function acted like the cout function back in c++. The alert() function is also handy, as it displays the result in a neat textbox.
2. Conditional statements are useful for narrowing down paths. Since they act like a branching tree, you can code in any event needing an input and a condition. 
3. Defining variables. Unlike c++, there are two main types, let and consts. Let variables, defined with "let" can change, while consts defined with "const" are constant and static.
4. Loops. Like back in CS2, for loops are used with a set amount of repetition. while loops though account for variability and typically use the inputted variable.
5. Arithmetic opearators are used to change numerical values. This is extremely useful when creating any program involving any type of arithmetic, such as determining, probability games, and averaging.

## 2/ Five topics I know not as thorough

1. Debugging. How the hell do you fix faulty code!???!?!?!??!??! IT MAKES ME WANT TO PULL ALL MY HAIR OUT AAJHDGUWDGDUW3FWEUGFWEIFGWIGFIGEUIEURFVI
2. Loops in loops. It gets hard sometimes keeping up with all the simoultaneous work going on.
3. Website interactables. How the hell do you do buttons
4. String-Numerical interactions. I haven't played with this much, so most of the stuff I know is mostly speculation from sparse google searches.
5. Exponents. Do you just while loop them or something.

## How will I combat 2/

Google stuff and do random coding

## Activities that weren't that helpful

1. The debugging one, i hate that one with a passion. If i didn't write it, i have zero idea how it works.
2. The ones with buttons. It was confusing and I learned very little.
